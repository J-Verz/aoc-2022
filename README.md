# AOC 2022
These are my solutions to the challenges of Advent Of Code 2022, spoiler alert but I doubt that wasn't clear yet. 
As I don't have time during December to spend multiple hours each day on this, I decided that I will tick off two days every month for the upcoming year, leaving me with a spare challenge to do whenever I fancy.

My goal is to learn more Ruby and further improve my OOP skills, which is why you will probably see a lot of OOP based approaches in here although they may not always be the fastest or best ways to solve the challenges. But then, I am not striving to be the first solving them.
